Challenge is to build out this dictionary web app using the Dictionary API and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
Dictionary API - https://dictionaryapi.dev/

Users should be able to:

- Search for words using the input field
- See the Free Dictionary API's response for the searched word 
- See a form validation message when trying to submit a blank form (Whoops, can't be empty...)
Play the audio file for a word when it's available
Switch between serif, sans serif, and monospace fonts
Switch between light and dark themes
View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
Bonus: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. Hint: Research prefers-color-scheme in CSS.

Sorry pal, we couldn't find definitions for the word you were looking for. You can try the search again at a later time or head to the web instead
